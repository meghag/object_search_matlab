% RANDOM_SEARCH
% Goal: reveal state of ALL voxels by choosing actions randomly.
% Let us see how different horizon lengths affect no. of actions and time
% taken to explore everything.

% INPUT:
% dim1 - along Y
% dim2 - along X
% res - grid resolution
% objLocationIndices - indices of true object locations
% horizon - no. of steps to look ahead while planning

% OUTPUT:
% iteration - no. of iterations taken to reveal as much as possible.
% n_actions - no. of actions *executed* (not planned) to reveal as much as
% possible. executed <= planned.
% time_taken - time taken to run the algo.
% unknown_state - no. of voxels whose state could not be revealed (always
% zero in this case).
